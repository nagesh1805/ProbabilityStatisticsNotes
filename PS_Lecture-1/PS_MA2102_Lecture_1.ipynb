If it turns out that exactly $m(20)$ of $n(50)$ antennas are defective, what is the probability that the resulting system will be functional ?For instance, in the special case where n=4, and m=2 there are 6 possible system configurations, namely, <span style=\"color:red\">0 1 1 0</span>, <span style=\"color:brown\">0 1 0 1</span>,<span style=\"color:green\">1 0 1 0 </span>,<span style=\"color:blue\"> 0 0 1 1</span>, <span style=\"color:orange\">1 0 0 1</span>,<span style=\"color:DeepPink\"> 1 1 0 0</span>    \n",

First 3 arrangements in our listing functional and remaining 3 are not, so it seems reasonable to take $\\frac{3}{6}=\\frac{1}{2}$ as the desired probability. In the case of general $n$ and $m$, we could compute the probability that the system is functional in a similar fashion, as long as we could list them. But From for general large m , and n the number of configurations may be so large to list them all. So it would be useful to have an effective method for counting the number of ways that things can occur. In fact many problems in probability theory can be solved simply by counting the number of different ways that a certain event can occur. The mathematical theory of counting is formally known as Combinatorics."
